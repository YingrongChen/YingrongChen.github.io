As a practice for eventually writing her epitaph, momo decides to write more with the help of her friend, GiHub Copilot. 

Just joking. Hi there! I'm Momo. My official name is Yingrong Chen, but I gave myself an English name in high school, like many Chinese students do (I used to be named 'Cherry' by an after-school English tutor in primary school but that got made fun of a lot in middle school due to its other meaning.) Anyway I haven't quite decide my writing style, so I might ramble for a while.

I am turning 23 in two and a half months. Yesterday my current boyfriend mentioned that he was gonna write me a program to confess to me, but we ended up calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend before he ever configured the frameworks. He is a crazy procrastinator ENTP. But maybe I can give myself a program gift.

Copilot keeps telling me to say "I am a software engineer, graduated from ...", which makes me a bit concerned about security and privacy. Will he (or she or they) eventually learn too much about me and can say every sentence that I want to say, and becomes my replaced brain. But I am a gen Z who grew up around terrifying scientific forecasts, and I am a CS major who knows transformer on a surface level.

For me, writing is a way to dump my old thoughts, visualize them on papers or screen, and reorganize into hopefully somethings that useful or amusing to other people.
